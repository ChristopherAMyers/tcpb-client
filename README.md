# TeraChem Protocol Buffer (TCPB) Client #

This repository is designed to facilitate the development of C++ and Python clients for communicating with TeraChem.

These clients use C-style sockets for communication, and Protocol Buffers for a clean, well-defined way to serialize TeraChem input & output.
